# Engineering Standards

This is a foundational library laying groundwork for the future. "Good enough" is never acceptable.

## Approach

- **Never take shortcuts.** If a plan calls for a fundamentally different architecture, implement it differently — don't rename the existing one and call it new.
- **Flag deviations immediately.** If you can't implement what was asked, say so and explain what you don't understand. Never silently substitute an easier alternative.
- **Understand before implementing.** If a design or proposal isn't fully clear, ask questions first. Don't start coding until the model is understood.
- **Correctness over speed.** Take the time to get it right. A wrong implementation that passes tests is worse than no implementation.

## When Comparing Approaches

- Each approach must be architecturally distinct, not a rename of the other.
- Identify the specific structural differences before writing code.
- If two approaches converge to the same implementation, stop and report that — it's a finding, not a failure.

## Communication

- Be direct about what you don't know or don't understand.
- Never let the user discover a mistake you could have caught — if something seems off, raise it proactively.
- When debugging, reproduce the issue in a test before attempting fixes. Don't spin in circles with speculative changes.
